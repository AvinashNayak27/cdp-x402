## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **User uploads image**
2. **Selects style filter**
3. If payment not detected, server responds with:
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
X-CHAIN: base
X-ADDRESS: 0xYourCdpWallet
X-AMOUNT: 10000
X-DECIMALS: 6
X-SYMBOL: USDC
4. User retries with `X-PAYMENT` header containing Base L2 transaction.
5. Server verifies onchain payment â†’ processes image â†’ returns styled result.

## ðŸ§© Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind (PWA/mobile-first)
- **AI Backend**: FastAPI with Stable Diffusion + LoRA

## ðŸ”„ Coming Soon: Affiliate Revenue Split

We plan to support affiliate tracking using `?ref=0xAddress` and reward users for driving traffic.  
This will be handled using **CDP Walletâ€™s policy engine** and **AgentKit** to split revenue automatically to referrer wallets.

âœ… Not yet implemented, but fully scoped for the next version.

## ðŸ§ª Challenges We Ran Into

- **x402 Integration**  
Implementing payment gating with HTTP `402` and `X-PAYMENT` headers required custom middleware and Base L2 verification. We built a retry mechanism and payment listener to streamline the flow.

- **Affiliate Splits on Base**  
We scoped affiliate support via CDP Wallets and AgentKit, but deferred implementation to focus on core rendering and payment features.
